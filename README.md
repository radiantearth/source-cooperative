Source Cooperative is a new data publishing utility that allows trusted organizations and individuals to share data products with one another using standard HTTP methods. You can see the current beta version at [https://beta.source.coop](https://beta.source.coop/).

Source Cooperative is the next generation of [Radiant MLHub](https://mlhub.earth/), our library dedicated to open Earth observation training data.

The purpose of this repository is to allow the public to have a place to leave suggestions about Source Cooperative and its development. 

# Current Beta Version (beta.source.coop)

The beta version of Source Cooperative is publicly available and can be found at [beta.source.coop](https://beta.source.coop/). 

# Development Roadmap 

You can see our roadmap in the [Milestones](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/milestones) of this repository. There, you can see the features we are actively working on and whether they will be included in the [summer 2023 release](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/milestone/1) or still do not have a timeframe for their integration (see [TBD Milestone](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/milestone/2)).

# Interact with Existing Planned Features

You are welcome to make comments and add ideas to the existing planned features we have in the docket in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/issues). 

# Suggest a Feature
