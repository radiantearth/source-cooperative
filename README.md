Source Cooperative is a new data publishing utility that allows trusted organizations and individuals to share data products with one another using standard HTTP methods. You can see the current beta version of Source Co-op [here](https://beta.source.coop/).

Source Cooperative is the next generation of [Radiant MLHub](https://mlhub.earth/), our library dedicated to open Earth observation training data.

The purpose of this repository is to allow the public to have a place to leave suggestions about Source Cooperative and its development. 

# Current Beta Version (beta.source.coop)

The beta version of Source Cooperative is publicly available and can be found at [beta.source.coop](https://beta.source.coop/). 

# Development Roadmap 

At Radiant Earth, transparency is a core value and we're excited to share our latest developments with you.

There are still many features we have planned for Source Cooperative that are not yet integrated into the current beta release. 

To give you a clearer picture of our roadmap, we have outlined our plans in the [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/milestones). There, you can see the features we are actively working on and whether they will be included in the [summer 2023 release](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/milestone/1) or still do not have a timeframe for their integration (see [TBD Milestone](https://github.com/radiantearth/source-cooperative/milestone/2)).
